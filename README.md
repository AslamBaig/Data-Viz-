To provide a more interesting narrative I gathered the happiness index and GDP data from kaggle and I freamed a few hypotheses

Hypotheses:-

1: Do the visitors count visiting London depends on the Happiness Rank of that country?

2: Does the countries with highest GDP have more people from that country visiting London?

3: Do the people in the countries with highest GDP are more Happy?

4: Do the people from countries with highest GDP Spend more at visiting?

Using this dataset, an interactive and dynamic dashboard was designed using dash, HTML, python.
